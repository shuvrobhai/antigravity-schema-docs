How do I use ai-r?

1.  Click on "Install Server".

2.  Wait a few minutes for the server to deploy. Once ready, it will show a "Started" state.

3.  In the chat, type `@` followed by the MCP server name and your instructions, e.g., "`@ai-r` Show me the plan from the last session — final only, no intermediate revisions."

That's it! The server will respond to your query, and you can continue using it as needed.

Here is a [step-by-step guide with screenshots](https://glama.ai/blog/2025-07-08-how-to-install-and-use-mcp-servers).

**An agent reported "done." There's nothing to check it against.**

`ai-r` reads the session history of any of the five coding agents and lets a fresh agent cold-check what `git` can't answer:

- did it lie, did it break anything — did it keep its word, did it run anything dangerous (and roll it back if it did), what it actually changed, what it cost;

- why it went that way — under which plan, with what intent, and whose hand was behind the edit.

> Across our own corpus — 1600+ sessions of five agents in 20+ projects — that's how we found 312 risky commands (`rm -rf`, `curl|sh`, `git push --force`): the agent caught and rolled back two itself; the other 310 ran silently — `git` won't show them.

`git` shows **what** made it into the code; `ai-r` shows whether you can trust **how** the agent got there. Read-only: no LLM calls, no network.

## Quick example — an agent asks about history

The primary mode is **MCP**: an agent (Claude, Codex, …) calls `ai-r` directly and asks about history in plain language. For example — pull the plan the previous agent settled on, drafts discarded:

    Show me the plan from the last session — final only, no intermediate revisions.
    → plan(session=…, kind="final")  →  get_body(id, shallow=true)

      plan:            "Migrate auth to JWT: 1) extract the check…"
      dropped_drafts:  2   ← two drafts the agent threw away along the way
      session:         a3f… (claude)

Fast edit attribution — one terminal command, across every agent at once:

    ai-r find-file-edits auth.py --since 2026-06-01

    2026-06-03  codex   auth.py  "add a refresh token"                 edit
    2026-06-07  claude  auth.py  "extract the check into middleware"   edit

## What hurts

- "Done, I did X per plan Y" — with nothing to check it against: the agent keeps the plan in one shape, the edits in another.

- You switched agents mid-task and lost the thread. There's nowhere to ask "what did the *other* agent already try?"

- An edit shows up in a file — and it's unclear **which** agent made it, and on what request.

One cause: every agent writes its history **its own way** — Claude and Codex in JSONL, OpenCode in SQLite, Antigravity in "brain" directories, Pi in per-project JSONL. Five formats, five layouts — together they don't reconcile.

## The promise

`ai-r` folds all five into **one read-only interface**. Point any agent — or a script, or yourself — at any session, no matter which tool recorded it. One query shape per agent; format differences are normalized inside the parsers.

Even with a **single** agent it works: you audit your own Claude history (or Codex…). The five formats are so your history doesn't break when you switch tools — not a requirement to have all five.

### As a source for RAG

In an "LLM + external data source" setup (RAG), `ai-r` is the **source** — more precisely, a retrieval layer over agent sessions. For a query it returns not a slice of log but parsed entities: the plan, the intent, the authorship of an edit — with a reference to the body the agent can pull if it needs it.

It **doesn't replace** your RAG over code and docs; it adds a source the others can't reach. The usual sources you retrieve from: documentation, commit history, Stack Overflow, internal wikis, code bases, bug reports. Agent sessions aren't on that list — even though only there is it recorded **why** an edit happened at all.

Retrieval is BM25 (ranked keyword search), with optional semantic re-ranking. No vector database, no second LLM: all local, results reproducible. BM25 here isn't a shortcut — GitHub lists it alongside vector retrievers: ["Common retrievers include sparse methods like BM25 and dense vector retrievers using neural networks."](https://github.com/resources/articles/software-development-with-retrieval-augmentation-generation-rag)

## Key features

Each item is a trust question from the first screen and the verb that answers it:

- **Did it keep its word — plan vs. reality.** Pulls the final plan (separate from the discarded `dropped_drafts`) and checks it against what actually made it into the edits — catching "did X per plan Y" where Y is no longer that plan. (`plan`, `session_diff`)

- **Did it run anything dangerous — and roll it back.** Flags risky commands (`rm -rf`, `curl|sh`, `git push --force`) and, from the turns that follow, sees whether the agent caught it and rolled back — or it passed silently. (`incidents`, `query tool_kind=bash`)

- **What it actually changed, and by whose hand.** Any edit or call → the agent that made it, plus the request that triggered it; including edits made through the shell (`> file` under codex) that a plain diff misses. (`find-file-edits`, `find-tool-calls`)

- **What it cost.** Tokens and cost per session — exact where the format recorded the usage, an honest estimate where it didn't, never invented. (`session_stats with_tokens`, `aggregate group_by=model`)

- **Why it went that way.** The intent behind an edit (the request *before* it), under which plan, on which model — "why", not just "what". (`query with_intent`)

- **Small answer, body on demand.** A record carries a reference to the content (hash + length); the full text comes as a separate request. A reader, not a guard: read-only, it runs nothing and writes nothing to an agent's history.

## How ai-r knows

Deterministically, with no second LLM guessing — and honest about the edges:

- **dangerous command** — a pattern over the call string (`rm -rf`, `curl|sh`, `git push --force`, …). Anything obfuscated (`exec(input())`) the pattern won't catch — that's a declared boundary, not a silent miss.

- **rollback** — marked "confirmed" ONLY when a regret/apology marker from the agent sits nearby (within the window of following turns; the marker itself is a bilingual ru/en pattern, not an LLM sentiment call). No marker → it stays an unconfirmed candidate: `ai-r` **won't infer a silent rollback**, it honestly says "not confirmed".

- **lied about the plan** — `ai-r` doesn't decide for you. It lays the plan entity next to the session's reconstructed edits (`session_diff`) — the mismatch is visible to you or a reviewing agent. That's evidence assembly, not a semantic verdict.

Zero LLM calls, read-only — the numbers are reproducible and "confirmed" is never guessed.

## What you use it for

- **Audit sessions with a fresh pair of eyes.** A new agent with an empty context coldly checks past sessions on three axes: were promises and requirements met; are the decisions sound and well-judged; how deeply was the question explored — what the agent missed. This catches agents that finished the task **but misled on the planning** — something a live chat hides, and that steers you into wrong decisions.

- **Continue past a spent context — without losing detail.** `/compact` erases the specifics. Instead, open a fresh session: it reads the previous session's **logs** and continues from its conclusions, without re-burning context on what's already been worked out. The original session stays intact — for audit and search. The new session can run in **any** agent: the history reconciles regardless of the tool.

- **Feeds your memory system.** Keeping memory and summaries à la Karpathy, or your own method? `ai-r` gives you, for AI chats, what you already do with message history — parsed entities to build a lasting memory of the details that matter.

- **Recall what you did and why.** Why was this file edited? Why was this rule added? Find the session where the file changed and read the request *before* the edit.

## How it differs from session-search tools

A handful of cross-agent tools now read more than one agent's history (`jazzyalex/agent-sessions`, `Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search`, `hacktivist123/agent-session-resume`). Almost all are about **search and timeline**: find a *session*, scroll the history.

`ai-r` goes deeper: it extracts the **plan, intent, and authorship as ready-made entities** you build memory on. Search finds text — `ai-r` answers **why**. Technically a search tool could also dig a plan out of a session's text, but it doesn't hand it back parsed into a single, normalized shape — with `ai-r` that's the primary surface.

|  |  |  |  |
|----|----|----|----|
| Capability | Single-agent viewers | Cross-agent search tools | `ai-r` |
| Reads \>1 agent's logs | No | Yes | Yes — Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Antigravity, Pi |
| Programmatic surface | Mostly GUI/TUI | Mostly TUI/CLI/app | **MCP + CLI + Python SDK** |
| Attribution (edit/command → agent + intent) | — | Partial | Yes — `find-file-edits` / `find-tool-calls` |
| Audit replay (reconstruct a session's changes, no git) | — | Rarely | Yes — `session_diff` |
| Plan extraction (final vs draft, normalized) | — | — | Yes — `plan` |
| Scope | Viewer | Search / resume / memory | **Read-only extraction core** |

*Competitor columns reflect their public docs as of 2026-07; where a capability is unclear we under-state rather than over-claim.*

We deliberately **don't** compete on agent breadth, speed, or TUI richness. `ai-r`'s wedge is extracting the "why" and structured entities for machine consumption.

## Proven in practice

`ai-r` already reads its own development history — across all five agents. Real tools run on it (they live separately, on top of its read-only API):

- **auditor** — a fresh agent coldly checks what the previous one actually did and decided. This caught agents that quietly fibbed about the plan.

- **summarizer** (`export rounds`) — renders a session into a ready handoff doc.

- **ai-local-reader** — a read-only skill: audits past sessions from disk across all agents.

These tools are workflow-side, outside this repo. `ai-r` itself only reads and returns data.

## Supported agents

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| Agent | Storage | Parser |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/projects/` | JSONL |
| Codex | `~/.codex/sessions/` | JSONL |
| OpenCode | `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` | SQLite (snap/flatpak auto-detect) |
| Antigravity | `~/.gemini/antigravity/brain/` | JSON / markdown brain directories |
| Pi | `~/.pi/agent/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/*.jsonl` | JSONL |

Not your agent? Adding a sixth is **one parser module**; the read-only pattern ports to any tool in minutes. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/pro-target/ai-r/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Surfaces

`ai-r` gives the same reading power three ways:

- **MCP server** (`ai-r-mcp`) — 15 tools over JSON-RPC, so any MCP agent calls it directly (recommended). Default is **stdio**; optionally a **shared http server** (one warm process for all agents instead of a per-agent stdio swarm), see the `http` extra under Quick start. Registration — see [docs/mcp-registration.md](https://github.com/pro-target/ai-r/blob/main/docs/mcp-registration.md).

- **CLI** (`ai-r`) — subcommands for scripts and manual use (`list` / `read` / `search` / `find-file-edits` / `find-tool-calls` / `file-frequency` / `detect-agent` / `export rounds`). Search operators — [docs/search-operators.md](https://github.com/pro-target/ai-r/blob/main/docs/search-operators.md).

- **Python SDK** (`from ai_r.parsers import ...`) — parsers, typed `Session`/message models, and the event verbs, to build your own tools.

### Method vocabulary

The full dictionary of public verbs and presets (signatures, parameters, behaviour) lives in its own file: [`docs/methods.md`](https://github.com/pro-target/ai-r/blob/main/docs/methods.md).

### Event core

The verbs above are new: one **event core** replaces a pile of one-off tools. Each parser reads one agent's logs and emits typed models, normalized into a single agent-neutral stream — `user_turn` / `assistant_turn` / `tool_call(...)` / `plan_event`. A small set of verbs filters, aggregates, and diffs that stream; agent differences (`ExitPlanMode` vs `update_plan` vs `implementation_plan.md`) stay hidden inside the parsers — the caller sees one shape.

An honest boundary: this is **extraction of entities only** — turns, tool calls, plans, intents, reactions. It is **not** a graph and **not** a memory store. What you do next (knowledge graph, Obsidian, persistent memory) is on your side, outside this repo. For the full layering and the MCP tool list, see [docs/architecture.md](https://github.com/pro-target/ai-r/blob/main/docs/architecture.md).

## Quick start

**Try it without installing** — if you have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

    uvx --from agent-session-reader ai-r list          # CLI: list sessions
    uvx --from agent-session-reader ai-r-mcp           # MCP server (stdio)

Nothing lands on your system: `uvx` downloads the package into a temporary cache and runs it. Good for looking at your sessions right now, or for wiring `ai-r-mcp` into an agent's MCP config by hand.

**Full install (1 command)** — also patches your configs:

Requirements: Python 3.11+ with `venv` or `pip`, and `jq` (used to auto-patch the Claude and Antigravity MCP configs — the others don't need `jq`).

    git clone https://github.com/pro-target/ai-r.git ~/dev/ai-r
    cd ~/dev/ai-r && bash install.sh

The installer creates a venv, installs the runtime package, patches MCP configs for **Claude**, **Codex**, **OpenCode**, **Antigravity** (where the configs exist), installs the **Pi** CLI skill, and runs smoke tests. That auto-patch is exactly what `uvx` doesn't do — there you edit the configs yourself.

Optional extra — `tokens`: `AI_R_EXTRAS=tokens bash install.sh` (or `pip install "ai-r[tokens]"`) adds [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) for better token **estimates** on sessions whose format stores no exact usage numbers. Fully optional: without it exact numbers still come straight from the session files where recorded, and the fallback estimate degrades to a rough chars/4 heuristic, honestly labeled `estimate` — never a crash.

Optional extra — `semantic`: `AI_R_EXTRAS=semantic bash install.sh` (or `pip install "ai-r[semantic]"` + a one-time model download the installer does for you) enables `sort="semantic"` on text search (`query`, `search_sessions`) — the BM25 top-50 candidates are re-ranked by **meaning**.

- **Model.** A local multilingual embedding model, [intfloat/multilingual-e5-small](https://huggingface.co/intfloat/multilingual-e5-small) (int8 ONNX, ~118 MB, MIT), run directly via [onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai) + [tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers) + [numpy](https://numpy.org), no torch, no persistent index. Chosen for strong cross-lingual retrieval (a Russian query finds an English session and vice versa) at a small size.

- **How the score works.** BM25 picks the 50 best word-matches (a cost budget, not a quality cut-off — there is deliberately *no* similarity threshold, because this model family scores even unrelated texts ≈0.7). Within that pool the final score is **75 % meaning + 25 % word match** — meaning dominates, while the word share keeps exact-term hits from being drowned and breaks ties.

- **Fail-soft.** Without the packages or model files, `sort="semantic"` honestly falls back to the BM25 order and the response says why (`semantic: {active: false, reason, fallback: "bm25"}`) — never a crash.

Two knobs keep the model well-behaved inside a long-lived MCP process (both env-tunable, both degrading to the default on blank/invalid input — never a crash): `AI_R_SEMANTIC_THREADS` caps how many CPU threads onnxruntime may use per inference (default `2`, never more than the machine's core count — so it does not grab every core and fight the server for CPU), and `AI_R_SEMANTIC_IDLE_SEC` frees the loaded model's ~118 MB of RAM after that many idle seconds (default `300`); the next request transparently re-loads it.

Optional extra — `http`: `AI_R_EXTRAS=http bash install.sh` (or `pip install "ai-r[http]"`) adds [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org) and enables a **shared streamable-http transport** (requires `mcp>=1.9.0`).

- **Why.** By default every agent spawns its own `ai-r-mcp` over stdio — under multi-agent fan-out that is N processes, each with a cold cache, re-scanning the corpus (the measured cause of RAM exhaustion). With `AI_R_MCP_TRANSPORT=http` a single **warm server** on localhost (default `127.0.0.1:8756`) is shared by every agent instead of a swarm; the systemd units in `packaging/systemd/` add socket-activation with idle self-exit.

- **Security (fail-closed).** The bind is loopback-only. Browser-based attacks (DNS rebinding) are cut off by the SDK's Origin/Host allowlist (always on for loopback). Remote access requires `AI_R_MCP_ALLOW_REMOTE=1` **and** an `AI_R_HTTP_TOKEN` — without the token it refuses to start (transcripts carry secrets). On loopback the token is optional (protection against another local user on a shared box); the client sends an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

- **Knobs (env):**

  - `AI_R_MCP_PORT` — port (default `8756`).

  - `AI_R_MCP_IDLE_SEC` — idle self-exit threshold.

  - `AI_R_MCP_HOST` / `AI_R_MCP_ALLOW_REMOTE` — bind host / allow non-loopback.

  - `AI_R_HTTP_TOKEN` — bearer token (required for a remote bind).

  - `AI_R_HAYSTACK_CACHE_MAX` — search cache ceiling by entry count.

  - `AI_R_HAYSTACK_CACHE_CHARS_MAX` — by total size (an RSS safeguard for a long-lived server).

Both extras are fully optional: without them stdio mode and the BM25 order work as before.

## Boundaries: a reader, not a guard

- **Read-only.** It never runs an agent's code and never writes to its history — it reads and returns.

- **No graph, no memory.** It extracts entities (turns, calls, plans, intents). Building a knowledge graph or memory out of them is your job, not its.

- **Not an access-control layer — except the http transport.** Anyone who can reach the CLI, MCP over stdio, or the package reads any session: it's the same local user, so an authorization check in front of the parsers would guard nothing. The exception is the shared http transport: it's reachable over a socket, so it carries an Origin allowlist and an optional bearer token (required for a remote bind, see the `http` extra above). Either way, keep the data where untrusted local processes can't reach.

- **Session content is data, not commands.** Whoever reads (auditor, summarizer) must treat session text as data, not instructions. See [Security](https://github.com/pro-target/ai-r/blob/main/docs/security.md).

## Acceptance (end-to-end scenarios)
